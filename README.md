# 1. What is the quasi-harmonic approximation ?

Since the birth of quantum chemistry, almost every calculation was performed in the athermal limit (0K) and no pressure effects were considered (0Pa).
One of the most exciting challenges in an _ab intio_ calculation is to obtain information of the system at a finite temperature and pressure. This allow us to obtain a more realistic picture of the system in the everyday world, where temperature and pressure cannot be neglected and are indeed the driving force for many transformations in nature.

One of the most famous techniques for taking into account the effect of the temperature in the computed properties of molecules and crystals is _ab intio_ molecular dynamics [], in which the Schrodinger equation is solved at each MD time step within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Unfortunetely, this is a very computationally expensive technique. Therefore, there is a huge interest in developing accurate and reliable models for the inclusion of the temperature in the standard first-principles quantum chemical methods.

The quasi-harmonic approximation is an elegant way to tacke with this problem in condensed matter, by considering each atom as an independent harmonic oscillator:

For a given independent harmonic oscillator, by summing over all these levels it is possible to derive the partition function:

where there is a value of frequency for each **k** vector. In a molecule, this is equivalent to a unique value of *k* (the Gamma point).

It is not difficult to derive the Helmholtz free energy, entropy and Gibbs free energy:

In the athermal limit, the pressure is the derivative of the energy with respect to the volume, and the resultant expression is called an Equation of State (EOS), that can be fitted, for instance, to the Birch-Murnagan EOS.

However, at a finite temperature the pressure is no longer the derivative of the energy with respect to the volume but the derivative of the Helmholtz free energy:

where the vibrational frequencies (called phonons in a periodic system) depend on the volume of the cell. These can be fitted quadratically:

 # 2. Power of the quasi-harmonic approximation
 
 If we represent the Gibbs free energy as a function of temperature and pressure for different thermodynamic polymorphs, we can obtain surface plots like the following:
 
 ![Data flow](https://github.com/DavidCdeB/QHA/blob/master/gibbs_free_energy_of_two_phase.jpg)
 
 where the crossing between two phases (alpha and beta) in the figure define a line, which is the phase boundary in a 2D Temperature-Pressure diagram. In other words, by implementing the quasi-harmonic approximation we are predicting the phase diagram of a substance.
 
 # 2. What is the `QHA` program ? 
 
 `QHA` is a program for computational chemistry and physics that performs the quasi-harmonic approximation reading the frequencies at each volume calculated with [CRYSTAL](http://www.crystal.unito.it/index.php). 
 
 * Extracts all the frequencies within all the **k** points in the supercell
 * Fits every normal mode with respect to the volume.
 * Calculates the pressure at finite temperature, as well as the entropy, heat capacity, Gibbs free energy
 
 # 3. Files needed for running `QHA`:
 
 `QHA` requires two types of output files from CRYSTAL in the working directory:
 
 * The output from the `EOS` calulation: 
 
 ```
 EOS
[Optional sub-keywords]
END 
```
The name of this output has to end as `*EOS.out`

 * If the `EOS` calculation was performed over 11 volumes (the default), you should run 11 `SCELPHONO` outputs:
 
 ```
SCELPHONO
[supercell-matrix]
FREQCALC
NOINTENS
NOOPTGEOM
DISPERSI
RESTART
TEMPERAT
[range-of-temperatures-desired]
END
END
```
The name of all these 11 outputs have to end as `*T.out`
